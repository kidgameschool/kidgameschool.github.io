      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed a website. I want to make indie games and share my experiences along the way. As a full-time worker and a father of a 4-year-old girl, this is no small goal, but Iâ€™m excited to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the domain name was very difficult. Initially, I wanted a cool, creative, and meaningful name. However, coming up with one felt like travelling into an endless black hole. If the name is completely new, it feels like no one would know what the site was about. If the name is modified from existing words, it looks childish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
